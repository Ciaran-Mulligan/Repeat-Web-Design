                        <h2>The Future of Exploring the Universe</h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>What</b> is the future of space exploration? <b>When</b> will we be able to explore? <b>How</b> can mirrors be real if
                            out eyes aren't real?
                            <br>
                            These truly are questions for the ages, luckily one of those ages is now.
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As far as the <b>What</b> is concerned we really don't know beyond mars although my personal opinion is seeing the progress of SpaceX
                            and the attitude of their ceo elon musk the propulsion system will most likely run on some form of edgy tweets with
                            all the volatility of Tesla options.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With regards to the <b>when</b> I can 100% assure that I have no idea but probably not in our life times, which is 
                            actually a good thing as it means we won't be around they inevitably reach the center of the universe and awaken
                            the Blind Idiot God.

                            There is no doubt that Mars is currently the most highly sought after destination of all space agencies and for
                            good reasons: It would be the first manned interplanetary spaceflight and much more importantly is currently 
                            has on its surface something that Mark Rober himself worked on.

                        <p>
                            When asked about his thoughts on the matter of futute space tavel Rober had this to say "DO IT JUST DO IT.
                            Don't let your dreams be dreams, Yesterday you said tomorrow, SO JUST DO IT MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE, JUST DOOOOO IT.
                            Some people dream of success while you're gonna wake up and work HARD AT IT NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE.
                            You should get to the point where anyone else would quit and you're not gonna stop there!
                            NO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? DO IT! JUST DO IT! YES YOU CAN, JUST DO IT! If you're tired of starting over, STOP GIVING UP./"
