                            The space race began when our former alien overlords (The Silence) required
                            us to begin building them space suits as we possessed minerals they did not but as we
                            all know they were in the end thwarted due to the efforts of the eleventh doctor
                            and his travelling companions: Amy Pond, Rory Williams and River Song.
                        </p>

                            Despite being one of the elevenths shortest arcs it is rememberd very fondly,
                            infact some people consider the 'Silence' arc to be his best. From the characters
                            to the acting to the dialogue it is easy to see why would consider it be so, myself
                            among them
                            <br>
                            It is also the first time in doctor who in which we see the doctor directly affect
                            his own future through his future interacting with his past(say that ten times fast),
                            which does raise some question about the integrity of the story considering this means
                            the doctor could have done in the past but either couldn't figure out how or even worse
                            just decided not to.

                            Edvard Munch's 1893 painting 'The Scream' served as the inspiration for 'The Silence'
                            as can be seen by the elongated body and face with large eyes alien shaped head.
